# Cplusplus-Program

    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project took user input for hours, minutes, and seconds and presented it nicely in both a 12-hour and 24-hour clock. It then allowed the user options to add an hour, minute, or second to the time, similar to a regular alarm clock. 
    
    What did you do particularly well?

I felt surprisingly good about this whole project. It was overwhelming to read the prompt at first, but once I wrote out some ghost functions and began to see the breakdown of pieces, it actually became quite manageable. That being said, I would say the organization of the project was something I did particularly well. 
    
    Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

In my mind, the code that prints out the time could be improved. It displays properly, but it just seems messy to read. I'm honestly not sure if it could be made better, but it's easily the most confusing part of the program to glance over. Another area would be user input. It functions perfectly with numeric input, but requires some more exception handling to properly deal with input that is not an integer. 
    
    Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging portion of this was getting the clock to display properly. Not the actual time, mind you, but the format of the boxes around the clocks. I initially had the clocks output consectively as two separate functions, which was no problem at all, but quickly realized that this was not going to work because they needed to be side by side. Making them one function and having all the spacing line up properly was challenging. 
    
    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

For me, the biggest success of this project was using functions properly. I've always had a hard time with multi-function problems and not having everything in main. However, I felt like I did a really nice job on this project and it boosted my confidence significantly, since main is literally only 5 lines long and has ZERO code of its own, only calling functions. 
    
    How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

For the most part, this program is fairly easy to understand the way I have it set up. But I further enhanced the readability of it by adding comming on sections that are not immediately understandable. I also wrote a comment signifying each line of the output so that it was easy to find in the future, as I can imagine figuring out where to add a space or an asterisk would be challenging in the future.
